# python3_machine_learning_in_action
This project mainly is my own codes implementing in python3 for book "Machine Learning in Action".

Since the book "Machine Learning in Action" by Peter Harrington published by Manning Inc have mentioned many projects related to machine learning algorithms, but it only provides the source code in python2. I implement these algorithms in python3 here and hope it may help python3 users for reading this book.

The official page for this book can be found here: http://manning.com/pharrington/.
